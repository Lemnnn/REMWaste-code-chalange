# REMWaste Code Chalange

A frontend redesign of REMWaste as part of a coding challenge.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** (React + TypeScript) - Fast build tool and development server
- **TanStack React Query** - Fetching and managing server-side data
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling framework
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **Lucide React** - Icon library for UI enhancements

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lemnnn/REMWaste-code-chalange.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd REMWaste-code-chalange
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

- **Modern UI Design**: The redesign focuses on improving the user experience with a cleaner and more visually appealing interface. The layout is structured for better readability and usability, with clear typography, button states, and hierarchy. Enhancements include better spacing, improved contrast, and a streamlined selection process.

- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Utilizing TanStack React Query, the application fetches and caches data efficiently, reducing redundant API calls and enhancing performance. The use of stale-time and background refetching ensures the displayed data remains up-to-date without unnecessary loading states.

- **Responsive Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for a highly responsive and scalable design. Components dynamically adjust across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Optimized Routing**: With React Router, navigation between different pages is seamless and efficient. URL parameters are managed effectively to maintain user state and selections. This improves the flow of selecting items and progressing through the steps without unnecessary reloads.

## Usage

- Navigate through the app using provided routes.
- Data is fetched asynchronously and displayed with React Query.
- Icons enhance usability with Lucide React.

## Notes

- The API data was provided as part of the challenge.
- UI/UX improvements were made while maintaining core functionality.
